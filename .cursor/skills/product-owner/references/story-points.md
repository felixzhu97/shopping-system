# Story Points

All **Story** and **Task** type tickets **must** have a Story Point estimate before entering Sprint planning.

## Field

| Field                | ID                  | Description                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Story point estimate | `customfield_10016` | Numeric value (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) |

## Guidelines

| Points | Complexity  | Description                        |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1      | Very Low    | Trivial change, no research needed |
| 2      | Low         | Simple task, well understood       |
| 3      | Medium      | Standard task, minor complexity    |
| 5      | Medium-High | Moderate complexity, some unknowns |
| 8      | High        | Complex task, multiple components  |
| 13     | Very High   | High risk, needs decomposition     |

## Rules

- **Every ticket must have SP** before entering Sprint planning
- Use Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- If a task exceeds 13 SP, consider splitting it
- Completed tickets should be used to calibrate future estimates
