# Extreme Programming (XP)

Map XP to this repo. Do not invent a second process — reuse DDD / BDD / TDD / PO / Customer already in place.

**XP** sets **cadence and feedback**. **DDD** owns the model. **BDD** owns behavior language.

## Values → this repo

| Value         | Practice here                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Communication | Glossary Preferred Terms; AC in business language          |
| Simplicity    | Smallest correct change; YAGNI                             |
| Feedback      | TDD + CI green before merge; Customer / AC review          |
| Courage       | Refactor while green; delete dead code in scope            |
| Respect       | Collective ownership within the task; no drive-by rewrites |

## Practices → This Repo

| XP practice            | Do this                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Planning Game          | Shape work with [Product Owner](../../product-owner/SKILL.md); estimate SP; behavior first, design second |
| Small Releases         | One outcome per PR; Chain PRs when dependent; no unrelated piles                                          |
| Metaphor               | [Glossary](../../../../docs/Glossary.md) as shared language                                               |
| Simple Design          | Pass tests with the simplest structure; no speculative abstractions                                       |
| Test-First / TDD       | [testing](testing.md) — Red → Green → Refactor                                                            |
| Refactoring            | Improve design only while tests stay green; keep diffs reviewable                                         |
| Pair Programming       | Sync decisions with the human when pairing or reviewing; no empty ceremony                                |
| Collective Ownership   | Improve any module needed for the ticket; stay in scope                                                   |
| Continuous Integration | Run relevant tests locally; keep CI green on the PR                                                       |
| On-site Customer       | Use [`customer`](../../../agents/customer.md) for user-value feedback; PO for stories / AC                |
| Coding Standards       | [architecture](../../../rules/architecture.mdc) + naming + this skill                                     |
| Sustainable Pace       | Do not overload a single PR; ship the next slice later                                                    |

## Rules of thumb

1. **Customer / AC first** — know the outcome before coding
2. **Small steps** — vertical slice that can merge soon
3. **Test first** for domain / application behavior
4. **Refactor** after green; do not skip the third step
5. **YAGNI** — no feature, config, or layer “for later”
6. **CI green** before asking for review / merge
