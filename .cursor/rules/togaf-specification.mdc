# TOGAF guidance (shopping system)

This repository maintains TOGAF views as PlantUML diagrams. The diagrams should reflect the current repository structure and the actual runtime dependencies.

## Diagram files

- `docs/architecture/togaf/business-architecture.puml`
- `docs/architecture/togaf/application-architecture.puml`
- `docs/architecture/togaf/data-architecture.puml`
- `docs/architecture/togaf/technology-architecture.puml`

## Repository mapping (high level)

- `apps/web`: Next.js web app (fetch, Zustand, i18next)
- `apps/mobile`: Expo + React Native app (Axios, Zustand)
- `apps/admin`: Angular admin app (ECharts + AG Grid for analytics: Orders/Products/Users tabs; Three.js 3D viewer; socket.io-client for meeting; Web Speech API TTS/STT; MyMemory API for translation)
- `apps/crawler-cli`: Node.js CLI crawler (cheerio)
- `services/api`: Express API (serverless-http, mongoose, bcryptjs, swagger)
- `services/crawler`: FastAPI crawler (httpx, BeautifulSoup4)
- `services/data-mining`: offline Python jobs and notebooks
- `services/meeting-signal`: Node.js + Socket.IO signaling server (WebRTC rooms, chat)
- `packages/*`: shared packages (components, types, utils, monitoring, auth, payment integration, test utils)
- `scripts`: seed scripts (products via seedProducts200; orders and users via seedOrdersAndUsers; cleans before seeding)

## Rules

- Use English only in diagrams and documentation.
- Keep names consistent with the repository folders and package names.
- Avoid redundant components and duplicated responsibilities.
- Do not invent services that do not exist in the repository.
- Keep diagrams simple and focused on boundaries and key dependencies.

## Generated outputs

- `docs/svgs/*.svg` are generated from `.puml` sources.
- Do not edit SVG files by hand.
- Regenerate SVGs after updating diagrams.
